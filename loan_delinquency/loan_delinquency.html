    <span class="badge">🔹 Step 1: Introduction and Business Context</span>

    <h2>🎯 Objective of the Project</h2>
    <p>This project simulates a realistic loan portfolio and borrower behavior to study loan delinquency. Using synthetic data generated with statistical logic and the Faker library, we model how different borrower profiles influence the likelihood of missed payments. The simulation serves as a foundation for building risk models and analyzing credit behavior in the banking domain.</p>

    <h2>🏦 Business Context: Why Loan Delinquency Matters</h2>
    <p>In banking and lending institutions, understanding borrower behavior is critical to managing credit risk. One key indicator of borrower risk is loan delinquency — when a borrower misses scheduled payments.</p>
    <p>A delinquent loan refers to a loan where the borrower has missed one or more payments, but the loan hasn’t yet defaulted.</p>
    <p><strong>Delinquency is an early warning signal of potential default.</strong></p>
    <p>Banks and lenders use delinquency metrics to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adjust credit policies</li>
      <li>Refine credit scoring models</li>
      <li>Launch early intervention strategies (e.g., calls, repayment plans)</li>
      <li>Manage capital provisioning (reserving money for potential losses)</li>
      <li>Optimize collections and recovery processes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 What is Delinquency?</h2>
    <p>A loan becomes delinquent when the borrower fails to pay on the scheduled date.</p>
    <p><strong>Delinquency is typically measured in buckets:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>0–30 days: Mild delinquency</li>
      <li>31–60 days: Moderate risk</li>
      <li>61–90+ days: Severe risk or default likely</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this simulation, we define delinquency as any loan with at least one missed payment over the observed period.</p>

    <h2>📉 What Causes Delinquency?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Low credit score or poor credit history</li>
      <li>Over-borrowing relative to income</li>
      <li>High interest rates increasing EMI burden</li>
      <li>Job loss, emergencies, or economic downturns</li>
      <li>Lack of financial discipline</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧩 How This Project Helps</h2>
    <p>This simulation provides a sandbox for analyzing delinquency behavior and supports:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Credit Risk Modeling:</strong> Use the simulated dataset to build Probability of Default (PD) models. Train logistic regression or XGBoost classifiers to predict delinquency.</li>
      <li><strong>Segmentation & Targeting:</strong> Segment customers based on income, score, and loan characteristics. Identify high-risk borrower groups.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy Testing:</strong> Simulate what happens if credit policies change (e.g., stricter loan limits for low-score borrowers).</li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio Monitoring:</strong> Use the generated data to test dashboards and delinquency trackers for operational use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔍 Future Extensions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Model Credit Risk KPIs: PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and EAD (Exposure at Default)</li>
      <li>Run scenario analysis: e.g., “What happens if inflation rises and incomes fall?”</li>
      <li>Track borrower transitions: From “current” → “30 DPD” → “60 DPD” → “default”</li>
      <li>Build early warning systems: Use payment behavior and score changes to predict delinquencies</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <span class="badge">🔹 Data Generation Using Faker and Statistical Logic</span>

    <h2>🎯 Objective of This Step</h2>
    <p>To create a realistic dataset representing loan accounts and borrower behavior over time. The dataset simulates various features relevant to loan delinquency modeling, such as borrower income, credit score, loan amount, and payment patterns.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ Data Simulation Approach</h2>
    <p>We use the Faker library to generate synthetic data, ensuring that the values resemble real-world distributions. Beyond just generating random data, we apply statistical logic and domain knowledge to craft a dataset that mimics actual borrower behavior.</p>

    <h2>👤 Borrower Profile Features</h2>
    <p>Each loan account in the dataset includes the following borrower-level attributes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer ID:</strong> Unique identifier for each borrower.</li>
      <li><strong>Income:</strong> Monthly income, simulated with a log-normal distribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> Assigned using a custom logic to reflect realistic credit distributions (ranges from 300 to 850).</li>
      <li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> Simulated based on income, ensuring proportional borrowing.</li>
      <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> Typically 12, 24, or 36 months.</li>
      <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Varies inversely with credit score to reflect risk-based pricing.</li>
      <li><strong>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment):</strong> Calculated based on loan amount, term, and interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> Loan initiation month.</li>
      <li><strong>Demographic Variables:</strong> Age, employment type, region, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📆 Monthly Grid Creation</h2>
    <p>We simulate a month-by-month view for each borrower using an exploded grid:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For each month, we track:
        <ul>
          <li>Payment Status (Paid/Missed)</li>
          <li>DPD (Days Past Due) Bucket</li>
          <li>Outstanding Balance</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Payment behavior is linked to:
        <ul>
          <li>Credit score</li>
          <li>Income-to-EMI ratio</li>
          <li>Random shocks (e.g., job loss simulation)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚙️ Missed Payment Simulation Logic</h2>
    <p>We define rules to simulate delinquency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Borrowers with low credit scores or tight income-to-EMI ratios have higher chances of missing payments.</li>
      <li>Payment status is assigned using probabilistic thresholds:
        <ul>
          <li>High score + high income → ~95% chance of on-time payment</li>
          <li>Low score + high EMI → ~40–70% chance of delay or miss</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Missed payments accumulate into DPD buckets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📊 Delinquency Flag Definition</h2>
    <p>A borrower is considered delinquent if any monthly record shows a missed payment or DPD > 0. This label is used for training and evaluating models later.</p>

    <h2>🔍 Example Simulation Rule</h2>
    <p>If a borrower has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Income:</strong> ₹25,000</li>
      <li><strong>EMI:</strong> ₹15,000</li>
      <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> 520</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then the chance of missing payment = 60% each month.</p>
    <p>If 3 consecutive months are missed → borrower enters 60+ DPD bucket.</p>

    <h2>🧪 Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Instead of a flat dataset, this time series simulation adds realism:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enables transition tracking (from current → 30 DPD → 60 DPD → default)</li>
      <li>Allows testing of credit policies and scoring models under realistic conditions</li>
      <li>Sets the stage for predictive modeling in upcoming steps</li>
    </ul>
