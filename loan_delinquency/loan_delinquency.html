  <!-- 📦 Design Block: Step 1 Content Section -->
  <div class="section">
    <span class="badge">🔹 Step 1: Introduction and Business Context</span>

    <h2>🎯 Objective of the Project</h2>
    <p>This project simulates a realistic loan portfolio and borrower behavior to study loan delinquency. Using synthetic data generated with statistical logic and the Faker library, we model how different borrower profiles influence the likelihood of missed payments. The simulation serves as a foundation for building risk models and analyzing credit behavior in the banking domain.</p>

    <h2>🏦 Business Context: Why Loan Delinquency Matters</h2>
    <p>In banking and lending institutions, understanding borrower behavior is critical to managing credit risk. One key indicator of borrower risk is loan delinquency — when a borrower misses scheduled payments.</p>
    <p>A delinquent loan refers to a loan where the borrower has missed one or more payments, but the loan hasn’t yet defaulted.</p>
    <p><strong>Delinquency is an early warning signal of potential default.</strong></p>
    <p>Banks and lenders use delinquency metrics to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adjust credit policies</li>
      <li>Refine credit scoring models</li>
      <li>Launch early intervention strategies (e.g., calls, repayment plans)</li>
      <li>Manage capital provisioning (reserving money for potential losses)</li>
      <li>Optimize collections and recovery processes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 What is Delinquency?</h2>
    <p>A loan becomes delinquent when the borrower fails to pay on the scheduled date.</p>
    <p><strong>Delinquency is typically measured in buckets:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>0–30 days: Mild delinquency</li>
      <li>31–60 days: Moderate risk</li>
      <li>61–90+ days: Severe risk or default likely</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this simulation, we define delinquency as any loan with at least one missed payment over the observed period.</p>

    <h2>📉 What Causes Delinquency?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Low credit score or poor credit history</li>
      <li>Over-borrowing relative to income</li>
      <li>High interest rates increasing EMI burden</li>
      <li>Job loss, emergencies, or economic downturns</li>
      <li>Lack of financial discipline</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧩 How This Project Helps</h2>
    <p>This simulation provides a sandbox for analyzing delinquency behavior and supports:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Credit Risk Modeling:</strong> Use the simulated dataset to build Probability of Default (PD) models. Train logistic regression or XGBoost classifiers to predict delinquency.</li>
      <li><strong>Segmentation & Targeting:</strong> Segment customers based on income, score, and loan characteristics. Identify high-risk borrower groups.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy Testing:</strong> Simulate what happens if credit policies change (e.g., stricter loan limits for low-score borrowers).</li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio Monitoring:</strong> Use the generated data to test dashboards and delinquency trackers for operational use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔍 Future Extensions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Model Credit Risk KPIs: PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and EAD (Exposure at Default)</li>
      <li>Run scenario analysis: e.g., “What happens if inflation rises and incomes fall?”</li>
      <li>Track borrower transitions: From “current” → “30 DPD” → “60 DPD” → “default”</li>
      <li>Build early warning systems: Use payment behavior and score changes to predict delinquencies</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <span class="badge">🔹 Data Generation Using Faker and Statistical Logic</span>

    <h2>🎯 Objective of This Step</h2>
    <p>To create a realistic dataset representing loan accounts and borrower behavior over time. The dataset simulates various features relevant to loan delinquency modeling, such as borrower income, credit score, loan amount, and payment patterns.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ Data Simulation Approach</h2>
    <p>We use the Faker library to generate synthetic data, ensuring that the values resemble real-world distributions. Beyond just generating random data, we apply statistical logic and domain knowledge to craft a dataset that mimics actual borrower behavior.</p>

    <h2>👤 Borrower Profile Features</h2>
    <p>Each loan account in the dataset includes the following borrower-level attributes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer ID:</strong> Unique identifier for each borrower.</li>
      <li><strong>Income:</strong> Monthly income, simulated with a log-normal distribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> Assigned using a custom logic to reflect realistic credit distributions (ranges from 300 to 850).</li>
      <li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> Simulated based on income, ensuring proportional borrowing.</li>
      <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> Typically 12, 24, or 36 months.</li>
      <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Varies inversely with credit score to reflect risk-based pricing.</li>
      <li><strong>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment):</strong> Calculated based on loan amount, term, and interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> Loan initiation month.</li>
      <li><strong>Demographic Variables:</strong> Age, employment type, region, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📆 Monthly Grid Creation</h2>
    <p>We simulate a month-by-month view for each borrower using an exploded grid:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For each month, we track:
        <ul>
          <li>Payment Status (Paid/Missed)</li>
          <li>DPD (Days Past Due) Bucket</li>
          <li>Outstanding Balance</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Payment behavior is linked to:
        <ul>
          <li>Credit score</li>
          <li>Income-to-EMI ratio</li>
          <li>Random shocks (e.g., job loss simulation)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚙️ Missed Payment Simulation Logic</h2>
    <p>We define rules to simulate delinquency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Borrowers with low credit scores or tight income-to-EMI ratios have higher chances of missing payments.</li>
      <li>Payment status is assigned using probabilistic thresholds:
        <ul>
          <li>High score + high income → ~95% chance of on-time payment</li>
          <li>Low score + high EMI → ~40–70% chance of delay or miss</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Missed payments accumulate into DPD buckets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📊 Delinquency Flag Definition</h2>
    <p>A borrower is considered delinquent if any monthly record shows a missed payment or DPD > 0. This label is used for training and evaluating models later.</p>

    <h2>🔍 Example Simulation Rule</h2>
    <p>If a borrower has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Income:</strong> ₹25,000</li>
      <li><strong>EMI:</strong> ₹15,000</li>
      <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> 520</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then the chance of missing payment = 60% each month.</p>
    <p>If 3 consecutive months are missed → borrower enters 60+ DPD bucket.</p>

    <h2>🧪 Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Instead of a flat dataset, this time series simulation adds realism:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enables transition tracking (from current → 30 DPD → 60 DPD → default)</li>
      <li>Allows testing of credit policies and scoring models under realistic conditions</li>
      <li>Sets the stage for predictive modeling in upcoming steps</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- 📦 Design Block: Step 3 Content Section -->
  <div class="section">
    <span class="badge">🔹 Tagging Borrower Delinquency Statuses</span>

    <h2>🎯 Objective of This Step</h2>
    <p>In this step, we assign a <strong>delinquency status</strong> to each borrower for every month based on their payment history. These statuses simulate real-world borrower risk progression and are essential for modeling and analysis.</p>

    <h2>📌 Why Tagging Matters</h2>
    <p>Instead of just labeling whether a borrower paid or not, we simulate how borrowers move through different stages of delinquency over time. This provides richer behavior patterns for modeling credit risk and borrower lifecycle events.</p>

    <h2>📊 Status Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Current</strong> – The borrower has made all payments up to that month (0 missed payments).</li>
      <li><strong>30 DPD</strong> – The borrower has missed one monthly payment (30 days past due).</li>
      <li><strong>60 DPD</strong> – The borrower has missed two consecutive payments.</li>
      <li><strong>90+ DPD / Default</strong> – The borrower has missed three or more consecutive payments. This is considered as defaulted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a borrower enters <strong>Default</strong>, they remain in that state permanently for the simulation, regardless of future payments.</p>

    <h2>⚙️ Tagging Logic</h2>
    <p>To determine the delinquency status, we calculate a <strong>Days Past Due (DPD)</strong> metric for every borrower-month using the following logic:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DPD = 0 → Status = Current</li>
      <li>DPD ≥ 30 and &lt; 60 → Status = 30 DPD</li>
      <li>DPD ≥ 60 and &lt; 90 → Status = 60 DPD</li>
      <li>DPD ≥ 90 → Status = Default</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a borrower reaches Default, all following months remain Default regardless of future payments. This mimics how many institutions treat defaulted loans — no reversion unless restructured or written off (not modeled here).</p>

    <h2>🔄 Transition Behavior</h2>
    <p>Borrowers transition through risk states as they miss consecutive payments. For example:</p>
    <p><em>Current → 30 DPD → 60 DPD → Default</em></p>
    <p>This logic reflects credit risk escalation in real portfolios. We maintain the history of past payment behavior so the model can learn how risk accumulates.</p>

    <h2>🧪 Example</h2>
    <p><strong>Jan</strong>: Paid → Status: Current</p>
    <p><strong>Feb</strong>: Missed → Status: 30 DPD</p>
    <p><strong>Mar</strong>: Missed again → Status: 60 DPD</p>
    <p><strong>Apr</strong>: Missed again → Status: Default</p>
    <p><strong>May</strong>: Paid → Still remains in Default</p>
    <p>Even though the borrower paid in May, the status doesn't reset, highlighting that risk accumulation is sticky in delinquency modeling.</p>

    <h2>📦 Final Output Structure</h2>
    <p>After tagging, our dataset now includes for every borrower-month:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Borrower ID</li>
      <li>Calendar Month</li>
      <li>Actual Payment Indicator</li>
      <li>Calculated DPD</li>
      <li>Final Delinquency Status Label</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This tagged status is the foundation for our downstream modeling (e.g., predicting who will default next month).</p>

<!-- ======================= STEP 4 START ======================= -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>🔍 Modeling Borrower Default Risk</h2>

  <h3>🎯 Objective of This Step</h3>
  <p>Now that we have monthly borrower behavior data and delinquency statuses, the goal is to train a model to predict which borrowers are likely to default in the upcoming months. This is the core of credit risk modeling and simulates how lenders make proactive decisions.</p>

  <h3>📌 Target Variable</h3>
  <p>The target variable for our model is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Default in Next Month (Yes/No)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This binary variable is created by shifting the “Default” status one month forward for each borrower. If a borrower defaults in March, their label in February will be 1 (positive), indicating default is coming. All other months are labeled 0.</p>
  <p>This setup ensures the model learns to recognize early signals of rising risk before actual default happens.</p>

  <h3>🧠 Predictive Features</h3>
  <p>We use features from the current and past behavior of each borrower to train our model. Example features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number of missed payments in the past 3 months</li>
    <li>Previous month's delinquency status</li>
    <li>Count of months since first delinquency</li>
    <li>Whether the borrower has ever been 30 or 60 DPD before</li>
    <li>Rolling average of recent payment activity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These features capture both short-term and long-term risk patterns.</p>

  <h3>🔄 Feature Engineering Logic</h3>
  <p>We perform transformations to create predictive features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rolling windows (e.g., number of missed payments in last 2–3 months)</li>
    <li>Flag variables (e.g., ever reached 60 DPD)</li>
    <li>Cumulative default indicators</li>
    <li>One-hot encoding of current status (Current, 30 DPD, 60 DPD)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each transformation adds temporal depth and mimics how banks track customer deterioration over time.</p>

  <h3>⚙️ Model Setup</h3>
  <p>We use a logistic regression model for interpretability and simplicity, though this setup can easily be extended to decision trees or ensemble models later.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Target:</strong> Will borrower default next month? (1 or 0)</li>
    <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Engineered features described above</li>
    <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> Borrower-month records before the month of prediction</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Standard train/test split, accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>✅ Interpreting Model Output</h3>
  <p>Logistic regression will return a probability score (between 0 and 1) for each borrower-month.</p>
  <p>We set a classification threshold (e.g., 0.5 or adjusted via ROC curve) to assign:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Default risk = High</strong> → If predicted probability ≥ threshold</li>
    <li><strong>Default risk = Low</strong> → Otherwise</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This output can help simulate risk segmentation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flag borrowers for early intervention</li>
    <li>Compare model predictions vs actual defaults</li>
    <li>Calibrate policies like grace periods or risk-based pricing</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧪 Example Scenario</h3>
  <p>If a borrower has:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Missed payments in Jan and Feb</li>
    <li>Is currently in 60 DPD</li>
    <li>Was Current 3 months ago</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then the model may assign a 0.82 probability of default in March.</p>
  <p>This allows early flagging before default occurs, mimicking real-world risk strategies.</p>

  <h3>🧾 Final Modeling Output</h3>
  <p>The final dataset includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All original borrower-month data</li>
    <li>Engineered features</li>
    <li>Predicted default probability</li>
    <li>Final model prediction (1 = predicted to default next month)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This output can be used for strategy simulation, dashboarding, or model evaluation.</p>

<!-- ======================= STEP 4 END ======================= -->

<!-- ====================== STEP 5: What Happens After Default ====================== -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>🔁 What Happens After Default?</h2>
  <div class="objective">
  <h3>🎯 Objective of This Step</h3>
  <p>
    Not every default is the end of the borrower’s journey. In the real world, lenders take post-default actions like restructuring, follow-ups, settlements, or charging off the loan entirely. This step simulates what happens after a borrower defaults—how they transition into long-term outcomes and how lenders can model these paths.
  </p>
</div>


  <h3>📌 Key Outcomes After Default</h3>
  <p>Once a borrower enters default, they are tagged with one of the following paths:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recovered</strong>: The borrower resumes payment after default and eventually becomes "Current" again.</li>
    <li><strong>Charged-Off</strong>: The loan is written off as a loss after a certain period of non-recovery (e.g., 120+ days past due).</li>
    <li><strong>In Collections</strong>: Borrower remains delinquent and the loan is transferred to collections for recovery.</li>
    <li><strong>Re-defaulted</strong>: A borrower who was marked "Recovered" but defaults again later.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These outcomes help simulate a complete credit lifecycle beyond just predicting default.</p>

  <h3>🛠️ Modeling the Recovery Process</h3>
  <p>
    After default, we track the next 3–6 months of borrower behavior to tag their final outcome. Here's how we simulate:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recovery</strong>: If a borrower transitions from 60 DPD → 30 DPD → Current within 3 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Charge-Off</strong>: If the borrower stays at 60 DPD or higher for more than 4 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Collections</strong>: If there's no payment activity for 2+ months post-default but charge-off criteria isn't met.</li>
    <li><strong>Re-default</strong>: If a borrower recovers but later returns to 30 or 60 DPD status.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This tagging logic is based on practical thresholds used by financial institutions.</p>

  <h3>📊 Creating Final Outcome Tags</h3>
  <p>
    We create a new column called <code>final_outcome</code> with values like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>"Recovered"</code></li>
    <li><code>"Charged-Off"</code></li>
    <li><code>"In Collections"</code></li>
    <li><code>"Re-defaulted"</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This tag is determined for each borrower based on their journey <em>after</em> their first default.</p>
  <p>We use rolling windows, flags, and recovery path checks to compute this.</p>

  <h3>🧠 Business Applications</h3>
  <p>This modeling of post-default behavior supports key credit strategies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Collections Prioritization</strong>: Predict which accounts are likely to recover vs. charge-off.</li>
    <li><strong>Loss Forecasting</strong>: Aggregate charged-off accounts to estimate portfolio loss.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Segmentation</strong>: Separate one-time defaulters from chronic delinquents.</li>
    <li><strong>Intervention Planning</strong>: Design contact strategies for collections or restructuring.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📌 Example: Borrower Recovery</h3>
  <p>Suppose a borrower defaults in May:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>June</strong>: Moves to 30 DPD</li>
    <li><strong>July</strong>: Becomes Current</li>
    <li><strong>Outcome</strong>: <code>Recovered</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Another borrower defaults in March:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>April–August</strong>: Remains 60 DPD</li>
    <li><strong>Outcome</strong>: <code>Charged-Off</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This flow adds realism and practical utility to the simulation.</p>

  <h3>🧾 Final Dataset Structure (Post-Default)</h3>
  <p>Our enhanced dataset now includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Original borrower-month features</li>
    <li>Default status</li>
    <li>Model-predicted default probability</li>
    <li>Final outcome after default</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This closes the loop from origination to default to resolution—simulating the <strong>entire delinquency lifecycle</strong>.</p>
